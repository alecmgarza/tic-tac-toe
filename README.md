# tic-tac-toe

## Overview
My goal with this project was to create a functional game of tic-tac-toe that can be played by two users on the same computer. The purpose behind the project was to practice using factory functions and module patterns.

### Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Features
Players have the ability to type their names into an input field and have them appear in their respective player cards. This is optional and player cards will default to displaying 'Player 1' and 'Player 2' if they do not enter names. The names are color coded to match the x's and o's on the gameboard, making it clear who is x and who is o. Players have the option to continue playing consecutive games, with their player cards keeping track of how many wins each player has accumulated. Text will appear above the gameboard indicating the results of the current game (who won or if the game ended in a tie).

## Bugs
- A player can change the mark of a spot on the gameboard after the other player has already marked it.
